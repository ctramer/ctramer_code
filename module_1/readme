There are two steps to be done in this section of the calculations

1) Please inspect the input.dat file carefully for your QCHEM parameters.

2) After you have set the input parameters, run the ./RUN_DFTFUNC.sh 
   in the RUNJOB folder. Thil will read the geometries from GEOMETRIES
   folder and generate the XX.in, XX.txt, XX.pbs and finally XX.out
   in TDDFT folder. You need these all XX.out files.
   This QCHEM runs will take several hours depending on 
   the architecture/environment of the server.  

MORE INFORMATION ON THE FILE ORGANIZATION:

1) RUNJOB folder consists of several folders as explained below,
GEOMETRIES: Please put all your geometries with index number.
            Please see the examples in GEOMETRIES folder.
DFT_FUNCTIONALS: It has several DFT functionals, BNL, B3LYP, wPBEh and SRSH
                in GAS and PCM.
TDDFT:This folder will be generated after running the RUN_DFTFUNC.sh script.
      If it is necessary save the output files to be used later.
      Please delete this folder for next run.
THE-TDDFT-outputs: Consists of TOP, HOLLOW and EDGE (shortly THE) output files
                    assigned as 1.out, 2.out and 3.out, respectively.
                    These results have been used already in PHYS REV Applied reference paper
