Additional explanation for;
1) NUMEXS: Use the tested value of 25 for SubPC-C60 and triad projects. Computational cost increases when higher values are used.

2) SNUMDON=NUMACC+1 if acceptor molecule is the first in geom.txt file
For example; in SubPC-C60 project first 60 atoms in txt file is C60 which is acceptor molecule and next 44 atoms belongs to SubPC which is donor.
So in the input file following indexings are printed,

sts_acceptor 1-60
sts_donor    61-104

3) In the case of TRIAD we have two donor molecules, namely, porphyrin(P) and carotenoid(C) and one acceptor molecule, C60.
So, in order to get correct charge separation from donor to acceptor
one need to define the regions as follow,

To get the CT states for porphrin;
sts_acceptor 1-60
sts_donor    61-125

to get the CT states for carotenoid;
sts_acceptor 1-60
sts_donor    126-207

4) DIEL and OPTDIEL: Consult to the literature for the studied system
